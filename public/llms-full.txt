### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**

    git clone https://github.com/waqar741/FinTrac.git
    cd FinTrac
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Environment Configuration**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory (or rename `.env.example` if it exists). Add your Supabase credentials. 
    
    *Note: Since this is a Vite project, variables must start with `VITE_`.*

    ```env

    Access the app at `http://localhost:5173` (default Vite port).

## 🗄️ Database Setup (Supabase)

This project relies on Supabase for data storage. You will likely need:

1.  A `profiles` table (often linked to `auth.users`).
2.  A `transactions` (or `expenses`) table with columns like:
    * `id` (uuid, primary key)
    * `user_id` (foreign key to auth.users)
    * `amount` (numeric)
    * `category` (text)
    * `description` (text)
    * `date` (timestamp/date)
    * `type` (text: 'income' or 'expense')

*(Check the `supabase/migrations` folder in the repo for the exact SQL definitions.)*

# User Guide (Info Page)

## Master Your Finances with Traxos
A simple, step-by-step guide to getting the most out of your personal finance tracker.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Dashboard**: Your financial command center. The Dashboard aggregates all your data to give you a real-time health check. View your total current balance, analyze monthly spending trends, and spot recent activity immediately upon logging in.
2. **Transactions**: Precision is key. Log every expense and income source with ease. Assign specific categories (like Food, Rent, or Salary) and add notes. Consistent logging allows the system to generate accurate reports on where your money is actually going.
3. **Saving Goals**: Turn dreams into reality. Whether it's a new laptop, a vacation, or an emergency fund, create specific goals with target amounts. Traxos visualizes your progress bars, motivating you to contribute regularly until you reach 100%.
4. **Debts & Credits**: Stop awkward money conversations. Keep a precise ledger of who owes you (Credits) and who you owe (Debts). You can manage multiple people, record partial payments, and settle up cleanly without relying on memory.
5. **AI Assistant**: Your personal financial analyst. Stuck on how to budget? Wondering how much you spent on coffee last month? Just ask the AI in plain English. It analyzes your unique data to provide personalized insights and actionable advice.
